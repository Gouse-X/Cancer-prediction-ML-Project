# Cancer Prediction Project


## Project Overview:
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict cancer diagnosis (malignant vs benign) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.The implementation uses Logistic Regression and achieves an accuracy of over 95%.

## Dataset :
The dataset contains the features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.The target variable is the diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).

## Features:
The dataset includes 30 features such as:
1 radius_mean
2 texture_mean
3 perimeter_mean
4 area_mean
5 smoothness_mean and more.

## Implementation Steps:
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train-Test Split (70% training, 30% testing)
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
5. Model Evaluation

## Results :
* Accuracy: 95.9%
* Detailed classification report showing precision, recall, and f1-score for both classes.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`etc,.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook `cancer_prediction.ipynb`.
