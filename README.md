# Cancer Prediction Project

## Project Overview:
Machine learning model is used to predict cancer diagnosis and using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Dataset :
1. Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.
2. 569 samples with 30 features each.
3. Target: Diagnosis (Malignant/Benign).

## Features:
Includes measurements like:
1. radius_mean
2. texture_mean  
3. perimeter_mean
4. area_mean
5. smoothness_mean
6. compactness_mean
7. concavity_mean and more etc,.

## Results:
* Accuracy: 95.91%.
* Excellent performance in cancer diagnosis prediction.

## How to Run:
1. Install requirements: `pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy jupyter`.
2. Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`.
3. Open and run `cancer_prediction.ipynb`.

## Technologies:
1 Python
2 Pandas
